       " \"too big, too expensive and too far from downtown.  \\n\\ni was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. it wasn't.  i'm in direct sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when i'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   i understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  since you're so far out of nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \\n\\nthe property itself was great.  the hotel is huge but really pretty.  i enjoyed walking around but was really happy when i found what i didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the convention center.  it took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  bonus!  like i said, this place is ginormous.  \\n\\nroom: our room was great.  i shared a wonderful suite in the garden conservatory with 2 other girls.  we were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  we had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  it had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  it was different than what i was expecting, but whatevs.  it was fine.  so, i wasn't there at check-in.  the girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and i.  so, sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  our friend was charged $1200 for one room (i'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  yep.  she reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  the bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. it was all arranged by the bellman.  she was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  so, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  last i heard, the gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \\n\\ncheckout:  a freaking nightmare.  between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and i decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  it was not a short walk and we had a ton of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  ugh.\\n\\ni'm sure i'll be back for another conference (i am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but i'm not going to be happy about it.  i might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the conference stuff.\",\n",

(which was not one of the songs we had picked) the song quickly turned to a absolutely disgusting remake. the piano guy sang so our birthday girl about opening her thighs,tying her up, filling holes, splurging on her face, and cumming in her hair. it was even worse than that. her husband and family including parents were in the crowd but luckily couldn\\'t hear to well because the sound system is terrible. our birthday girl even stopped the piano man and told him to stop and he continued and made it even dirtier. it was disgusting, offensive, and embarrassing. trust me we are not prudes by any means but this was way too far. it completely ruined the experience and we all immediately left. we spent our time and money there only to have the birthday ruined. also for 35 dollars we paid we only heard 1 of the songs which they only sang  part of.',\n",

       " \"this review is mainly chicken talk as cuenelli's peruvian style rotisserie chicken brings to the table. pollo a la brasa.... rotisserie chicken.... whatever you wanna call it.... i call it a technique done here with love and pride. lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\\n\\nwhy do i think this chicken have some tlc put into it? on biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. this is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\\n\\nlets go to this rotisserie oven. another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. this gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. as these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. in turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken in the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. wait.... how can they add more flavor? cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\\n\\nround out this meal with some solid sides. must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. i got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) must have beans with rice no? i pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. i also love the maduros here. these sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \\n\\nwash all down with inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. chicha limena i say is christmas in a bottle. this juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\\n\\nthough cuenelli's peruvian style rotisserie chicken have many other notable latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. this chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. i say, go to cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.\",\n",

       " 'after a long hiatus from reviewing i have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is indian food. like an all too familiar pattern, i go back to mohammad butt, my main man for marsala.\\nbut whats this? \\nthere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"best taste of asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\\n\\nno.\\nno, it can\\'t be! \\ni need to score - one .. final .. hit..\\n\\nlife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. who am i?\\nwhy am i here?\\nwhat is cheeze wiz?\\nits done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as i prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in zaika.\\n\\nzaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. this is a place where the paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that\\'s silky in texture. especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white lego blocks most small indo-pak places purchase from indian grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. while at zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. for example, the chicken makhani uses smokey tandoori chicken, which i have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. even entrées like dall fray or  palak paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \\n\\nzaika \\'s appetizers, like the veggie samosa and aloo tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. though i must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. these peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. further, i find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\\n \\ni\\'ve become rather taken by zaikia. even the simply things such as the naan are good there. just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn\\'t too soft. it\\'s nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. the only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. but hey, i use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so i don\\'t mind at all.\\n\\nthe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\\nthough some items like lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \\nthe head chef speaks english quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\\n\\ni have already noticed parties negotiating catering for ramadan as i anxiously awaited my own order.\\n\\nthe bottom line here is this, mohammad butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"best taste of asia,\" and taken an all halal meat approach. \\n\\nonly good things can come of this, only good things.\\n\\np.s.\\nzaika is right behind nifty fifties on grant ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \\nhowever, i would suggest getting the ras malai if available. these riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. they are ungodly good.',\n",

       " 'unfortunately, i\\'m not happy after coming to this salon yet again. i got a message from the owner saying he\\'d like to have me come in to receive a free service because they previously ruined my hair. so, i thought since he\\'s the owner my hair would turn out good but i was wrong. i\\'m really unhappy with this whole experience. i showed him multiple photos on google of what i wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. i told him i do not want any orange in my hair as i wanted a \"white blonde\". he said you won\\'t have any orange in your hair. i have a message from him the owner saying i would receive a free service if i deleted my previous review. he should of never offered a free service if it wasn\\'t really free! so, i said how much because i thought i was getting my hair done for free. he said since your hair is long and thick you\\'ll have to pay for the hair color and \"medicine\" but he won\\'t charge me for his time. i said ok how much he said $80. he said it would cost me $180 if he didn\\'t give me a discount which is very pricey. he put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which i do not like. my hair is important to me, i don\\'t want my hair to fall out. he said this medicine he\\'s gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that i needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which i know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. you can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he\\'s definitely charging a lot of money! he only put no.1 on my hair and not no.2 or no.3. he also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because i asked if she\\'s styling my hair and she said she doesn\\'t do hair and i wouldn\\'t want her to do my hair. as i was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. she was done but she wasn\\'t happy, she told the lady she didn\\'t like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn\\'t happy. the girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? i know she left very unhappy! also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. that\\'s not a good look tj nail and spa! i had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. i seen orange roots, i was mad!!! he finally came over and i said i don\\'t like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it\\'s not orange it\\'s the lighting. the lighting?! it wasn\\'t the lighting! he proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if i wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. at that point i knew my hair wasn\\'t what i wanted and it wasn\\'t gonna be fixed even if i wanted it too. i just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! i looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what i wanted. there goes my money down the drain, yet again. i will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before i left his salon but i had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! like i said i showed the owner multiple photos and i stated i did not want any orange on my hair but i did have orange on my hair, i didn\\'t get what i wanted like he said, he said he doesn\\'t mess up, he\\'s been doing hair for years. as a salon owner i think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn\\'t be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. they just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don\\'t care if the customer is happy or not. there are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. i do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. i do reviews anywhere and i\\'m always 100% honest. so, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.',\n",
       " \"i am so glad we had our wedding here!!! i cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with breanna, the venue manager and eli, the food and beverage director. our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. everything worked out on all accounts! \\n\\nwe first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is gorgeous. the pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the santa barbara area, the riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.\\n\\nthe looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. with people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase santa barbara's cool architecture and vibe. the mansion is exactly that.  the layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. we were able to enjoy the california weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. it really has something for everyone.\\n\\nwhat i didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. when we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, breanna and eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! my dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from enjoy cupcakes- also a great idea!). eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. \\n\\nthe attention to bartending at the riviera mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name i forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. she even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! at the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. the staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). hell, eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! really spectacular and attentive service.\\n\\nfive stars all around. it was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.\",\n",

(they also had a really cool outdoor rooftop seating area for the bar, but was too cold and snowy to go out on) bankers field house was maybe 1 minute away walking. after the game we came back and got some drinks at plat 99 again, it was pretty crowded, fun environment. for breakfast we ate at the market place downstairs, it was one set price for a buffet and had a lot of good food.\\n\\nwe checked out at 11am- very easy and the concierge was friendly and helpful. before we left we spent about 30 minutes just walking around the hotel looking at all the art work, it is like a modern art museum. \\n\\noverall we loved this hotel, for a quick getaway to indianapolis, especially if you are going to a pacers or colts game, is was fantastic. next time i go back to indianapolis i will be staying here again.',\n",

       " \"when i was preparing to write this review and give sam's a particular number of stars, i encountered a dilemma.  should my star rating be based upon comparing sam's to all sports bars in which i have ever been?  or, should it be a comparison to nashville sports bars?\\n\\ni chose the former:  compared to everywhere - because if you're from out of town that only seemed fair.  the sad news is that for a vibrant southeastern city where we have two professional sports teams, our sports bars kinda suck.\\n\\nsam's is honestly one of two great sports bars in the city.  i really like sam's and i really like the patio in spring, summer, and early autumn.  but, when compared to so many sports bars across the country in other cities of comparable size with their own sports' teams... sam's is just mediocre.  \\n\\nthe service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since i was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  wow.  that was just really mean.  i'm sorry.\\n\\nthe food is on the better side of bar fare.  but their beer selection could want for some better beers and a wider variety of selection.  the mixed drinks tend to be a bit weak, in my opinion.\\n\\nbut, hey, it's a bar.  it has lots of tvs and they play the game commentary over the speakers throughout the bar.  all and all, if you want to watch sports at a bar, then i would recommend sam's.\",\n",

(my boyfriend is 6\\'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)\\n\\ndon\\'t expect much of a view. the view from our room was of the side of another building. but that\\'s what the city is for... go out there and see something!\\n\\noverall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. i highly recommend this hotel to anyone.',\n",

(hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out asap...). \\n\\nafter ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us at all. we drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. a couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \\n\\nonce our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... again. after coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \\n\\nthey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\\n\\nin summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the braised lamb was really good. but the sirloin was chewy and bland and the grilled caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). atmosphere was nice and trendy. but the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. \\n\\ni really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and i hate writing such a negative review, but i had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.\",\n",

       " \"the long and the short of it: a romantic little byob in newtown square that hits the mark in several areas. big portions at decent prices. you won't leave hungry!\\n\\nand now for a full review:\\n\\ni have been to this fellini's cafe and the one in bryn mawr several times and each time i've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\\n\\non my latest visit this past friday night, i made reservations for 730. my beautiful wife and i arrived right at 730. although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. and when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. odd.\\n\\nbeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. we asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. we shrugged and just rolled with it.\\n\\nthe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. it's a nice place for a romantic meal. but it is loud. so loud i would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually i'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\\n\\nour waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\\n\\nfor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\\n\\ncomplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only i find strange for an italian restaurant?). \\n\\noverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \\n\\n1. the caesar salad was served on a warm plate. the salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\\n\\n2. i am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\\n\\nwhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. that was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\\n\\nall in all, i'll keep visiting fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.\",\n",

       " 'this review is long overdue!  i visited stitch-it in june 2013\\n\\nin brief: stitch it did an excellent job on my dress and i was extremely pleased.  i needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, i didn\\'t mind paying a premium.  the service and results far exceeded my expectations.\\n\\ncomplete experience: i was attending a convention in nashville, tn and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  the gown was a navy blue tadashi shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. the gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. the dress arrived a few days before i was scheduled to fly out to nashville and i knew i wouldn\\'t have time to get it tailored before leaving.  i found a few nashville area tailor shops on yelp, read the reviews and decided i might try stitch-it.  i also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn\\'t give me the warm and fuzzies.  \\n\\nstitch-it was about a 30 minute drive from the gaylord hotel where i was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, i decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  when i took the dress to the gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"i can hem the bottom....i\\'d have to do it by hand.  the top part though....i won\\'t touch that with a 10ft. pole!\"  i laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that i needed done.  \\n\\ni contacted stitch-it and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who\\'s name i can\\'t remember (i think it was cameron...i could be wrong).  they assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so i hopped a cab and visited stitch-it.  when i arrived i was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  i was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  my personal tailor was maggie o\\'neill and she was awesome!  after the fitting and pinning, i left the gown and picked it up in two days.  it fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  if i lived in nashville, i would definitely use stitch-it on a regular basis.',\n",

       " 'after a long hiatus from reviewing i have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is indian food. like an all too familiar pattern, i go back to mohammad butt, my main man for marsala.\\nbut whats this? \\nthere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"best taste of asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\\n\\nno.\\nno, it can\\'t be! \\ni need to score - one .. final .. hit..\\n\\nlife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. who am i?\\nwhy am i here?\\nwhat is cheeze wiz?\\nits done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as i prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in zaika.\\n\\nzaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. this is a place where the paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that\\'s silky in texture. especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white lego blocks most small indo-pak places purchase from indian grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. while at zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. for example, the chicken makhani uses smokey tandoori chicken, which i have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. even entrées like dall fray or  palak paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \\n\\nzaika \\'s appetizers, like the veggie samosa and aloo tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. though i must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. these peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. further, i find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\\n \\ni\\'ve become rather taken by zaikia. even the simply things such as the naan are good there. just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn\\'t too soft. it\\'s nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. the only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. but hey, i use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so i don\\'t mind at all.\\n\\nthe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\\nthough some items like lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \\nthe head chef speaks english quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\\n\\ni have already noticed parties negotiating catering for ramadan as i anxiously awaited my own order.\\n\\nthe bottom line here is this, mohammad butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"best taste of asia,\" and taken an all halal meat approach. \\n\\nonly good things can come of this, only good things.\\n\\np.s.\\nzaika is right behind nifty fifties on grant ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \\nhowever, i would suggest getting the ras malai if available. these riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. they are ungodly good.',\n",

ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because i asked if she\\'s styling my hair and she said she doesn\\'t do hair and i wouldn\\'t want her to do my hair. as i was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. she was done but she wasn\\'t happy, she told the lady she didn\\'t like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn\\'t happy. the girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? i know she left very unhappy! also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. that\\'s not a good look tj nail and spa! i had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. i seen orange roots, i was mad!!! he finally came over and i said i don\\'t like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it\\'s not orange it\\'s the lighting. the lighting?! it wasn\\'t the lighting! he proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if i wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. at that point i knew my hair wasn\\'t what i wanted and it wasn\\'t gonna be fixed even if i wanted it too. i just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! i looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what i wanted. there goes my money down the drain, yet again. i will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before i left his salon but i had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! like i said i showed the owner multiple photos and i stated i did not want any orange on my hair but i did have orange on my hair, i didn\\'t get what i wanted like he said, he said he doesn\\'t mess up, he\\'s been doing hair for years. as a salon owner i think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn\\'t be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. they just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don\\'t care if the customer is happy or not. there are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. i do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. i do reviews anywhere and i\\'m always 100% honest. so, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.',\n",

       " \"very nice, quiet and dark restaurant. chinese and sushi offered. had szechuan chicken, hot and sour soup, and steamed rice. hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. just the right amount of food. didn't have to take any home. service was excellent.\",\n",

       " \"delicious top shelf pastries. i am outraged at the poor ratings. if you're looking for cheapness over flavor then go to panera. service has always been exceedingly pleasent when i go, and i am an obnoxious needy customer. we are so excited to have them make macaroons for our wedding.\",\n",
       " \"i could be craving pizza and be walking by and still not go in again. i will say the ingredients are definitely fresh and service was great however the pizza is just plain not good. the crust is so thin that the pizza is cold within a few minutes and it was just a little floppy and bland. i wanted to love this place but with so many other pizzerias in the area i won't be going back.\",\n",
       " \"love the tap room, but i can't seem to get the hours of business right.  my first visit was a kinda a let down.  i had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in indianapolis, but i only found 2 that i liked and only 1 was memorable.  however, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, i like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   the tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.  i only gave them 3stars this time but i look forward to improving their score after future visits.\",\n",
       " \"beautifully sweet ending to a sweet trip to nola with the girls. we stumbled upon this after a delicous savory lunch nearby at cochon (review to follow). sweet confections is on magazine st, around corner from the art gallery strip on julia st.   we had a sampling of cupcake (chocolate with mocha filling) and truffles (raspberry, creme brulee, and orange).  cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. the coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... i usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but i didn't even need it!  seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. enough for our 6-girl troop. and service was great, helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling.  gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person.\",\n",
       " 'pulled pork sandwich was delicious .. but! the lucky bun (asian fusion style ) burger . was a disappointment for the sole purpose of them using a frozen beef patty :/  the bread was good .. the toppings and sauces were great .. but just killed the flavors with a processed frozen beef patty .. if used a fresh ground meat .. it would have been a great gourmet burger ..',\n",
       " \"this is a great place to bring the kids to. they can have juice, a slice of cake, and homemade popsicles. they think it is a tea party. i have tried everything once and my favorites are the homemade doughnuts filled with read bean, the popsicles, the patbingsu, and even the good ol' coffee cream and sugar.\",\n",
       " \"always awesome!  best crust ever and super fresh ingredients and nice staff.  lots of yummy toppings that aren't offered at other pizza places.   great salads too! patio area is a cool place to kick back,have a beer or glass of wine and savor the best pizza in town.\",\n",

       " 'very cool bar attached to the alexander hotel. several vintage cocktails from pre-prohibition are on the menu. none cooler than \"the elephant in the room\" a bourbon cocktail which comes in its own decanter filled with cherrywood smoke. you decide how long to let it infuse. lots of comfortable seating and when it warms up a touch a large beautiful deck with seating and heating overlooks the street life. as an added bonus you can relax and watch people work out through the glass of the new cityway ymca. \\nand yes the truffle oil and sea salt popcorn that greets every patron is as good as it sounds. get a beer and start collecting bags, once you start you can\\'t stop.',\n",
       " 'this hotel is a gem in the heart of philadelphia.\\n\\nit\\'s a cozy, quaint, and charming property. the rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. \\nthe decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: looks more like a friend\\'s apartment than a hotel. \\n\\nfree breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. it\\'s not a hot breakfast (i\\'ve had so many mass-produced bad ones, so i\\'m not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! they leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. so if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it will be there. \\n\\ncoffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. there are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. the staff is very polite: one of the few places in philly where someone will actually say \"good morning\" to you (no, seriously. i lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). they\\'re also extremely helpful. when i checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure i had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that i could make my speaking engagement on time. while i was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so i asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, i had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.\\n\\ni\\'ve read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. my room was closest to the reception desk and i never heard a peep. there were people out and about, but i didn\\'t hear a thing. and i\\'m a very light sleeper...\\n\\na few things to note:\\nits location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you\\'re traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. the parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. \\n\\nthere\\'s a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. it fits one comfortably enough... provided that you\\'re not too far from average height and build. (my boyfriend is 6\\'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)\\n\\ndon\\'t expect much of a view. the view from our room was of the side of another building. but that\\'s what the city is for... go out there and see something!\\n\\noverall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. i highly recommend this hotel to anyone.',\n",
       " \"was taken here today by a colombian friend who needed to satisfy a craving for something cheap and delicious. this place reminds me of nanzhou, a yelp favorite, because of the heaping helpings you get for next to nothing. \\n\\ni got the oxtail soup (sancocho) with extra rice and plantains to see how it would differ from the korean-style stuff i was used to at home. aside from a thicker, stew-like broth and beefier potatoes, it was just as delicious. my friend got a flat steak (carne asada) that i think he ate in just under 10 seconds. \\n\\nremember yelp, you're missing out on a lot if you don't visit ne philly once in a while, especially this place.\",\n",
